## About me
Recently graduated in Computer Science from the Sapienza University of Rome, I am passionate about artificial intelligence and its subfields. I have experience using PyTorch Lightning, Weight & Biases, and Docker.

My research thesis focused on Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields, enabling novel view synthesis for dynamic data. In particular, I implemented a technique which improve these fields. In my university path, I have worked on numerous projects involving 3D objects such as Point Clouds, Meshes, and Implicit shapes.

My core competencies include:

- 3D Modelling & Geometric Learning
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Interpretability & Representation Learning
